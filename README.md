- Input line should start with either Bet or Result.
- Type of Bet should be from (W, P, E) only.
- Selection of horse should in integer only.
- Stake should be number.
- For exacta bet, selection should be in pair of 2.

# Assumptions
- If no input bet provided for any particular bet type then output will also not contain that bet type. eg: if input contains entries for only win and place then output will also contains only win and place and not for exacta.
- If horses in result entry is not present in input bets, then output for that bet type will be message like "No bet on this horse" for the corresponding bet type.
